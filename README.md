The node allows you to select specific terms or choose "random" to let the generator pick random terms from the corresponding JSON file. This randomness adds a degree of unpredictability and creativity to the generated prompts.

## Installation

1. **cd** to the custom_nodes folder inside of **ComfyUI** directory
2. **cmd** in the address bar, then use this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/fairy-root/Prompt-Generator.git
```

## Usage

1. **Add the "Prompt Generator" node to your ComfyUI workflow.**
2. **Configure the desired parameters:**

   - **Seed:** Controls the randomness of the generator.
   - **Custom:** Add any custom text to the prompt.
   - **Subject:** Specify the main subject of the image.
   - **Artform:** Choose the desired art form (Photography, Digital Art, etc.).
   - **... (All other parameters as described in the Overview section)**

3. **Connect the output of the node to a text-to-image model (like or Stable Diffusion...etc) to generate images based on the generated prompt.**

## Example

Let's say you want to generate a prompt for a portrait photograph of a woman with long hair, wearing a dress, and standing in a forest. You could configure the node with the following parameters:

- **Artform:** Photography
- **Photo Type:** Portrait
- **Default Tags:** Woman
- **Hairstyles:** Long Hair
- **Clothing:** Dress
- **Place:** Forest

The node would then generate a prompt similar to: "photography of a woman with long hair, dressed in a dress, in a forest."
